# Category Theory for Programmers

### What is going on here?
This repository offers a worked solution + notes to Category Theory for Programmers.

### Why
I'd argue why not, but I suppose it's a pretty core concept in functional programming and discrete mathematics.


### Notes
* This book was originally delivered in Haskell, so the F# port is my own interpretation of the actually correct information
* This requires the VSCode extension [.Net Interactive Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) and .Net Core 6.0
